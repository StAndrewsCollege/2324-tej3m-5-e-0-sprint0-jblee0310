##Research: 
Some people cut the paper in half and made a little gap with scissors on the paper so that the paper can hold each other. 
##Ideation: 
I tried to steal their idea but couldn't improve it. I tried many other creative ideas, but none of them worked. Better than just failing on doing it, I got the height of one A4 paper. 
##Prototype:

##Testing and Critique:
I realized that I needed more trial & error to get this working. Looking at how others did might help me improve from this. Maybe cutting the paper in half and using the half and folding it as much as possible to act as a base might be a way of improving on this.
##Final Design:
My final design consists of half of the paper on top of another half of the paper with a gap holding each other from falling. Since the half of the paper could not stand by itself, I folded it in half and created an angle so that it can stand by itself. 
##Conclusion:
I think I could have done a better job of structuring the tower and doing more research. I believe that discussing with others and sharing ideas will allow both of us to build on each other's idea to enhance our success.
